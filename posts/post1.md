This is my first post ever. I know that there's definitely a better way to store and render these blog posts but I want to challenge myself in creating tools in different languages so here we go. I am going to build a python tool that I can run to transform all the markdown files (each one of them is a post) into a single json "database" file. This json file is then read by my react app which in turn displays each blog post as a component.
